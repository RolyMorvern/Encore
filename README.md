In the **Encore project**, I used a dynamic tech stack:

- **React** for robust front-end development,
- **jQuery** for enhanced interactivity, 
- **GSAP** for some basic animations, and
- **CSS** for polished styling.

I used the following API's:

1. [theNewsAPI](https://www.thenewsapi.com/)
2. [Marketaux](https://www.marketaux.com/)


I deployed the app using vercel. [See it live](https://encore-five.vercel.app/)
