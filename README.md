In the **Encore project**, I leveraged a dynamic tech stack that seamlessly combined:

- **React** for robust front-end development,
- **jQuery** for enhanced interactivity,
- **GSAP** for some basic animations, and
- **CSS** for polished styling.

As part of this endeavor, I delved into the intricacies of the **Fetch API** in JavaScript, broadening my skill set and elevating the project's overall functionality. I also added multi-language support using he i18n JavaScript library.

I used the following API's:

1. [theNewsAPI](https://www.thenewsapi.com/)
2. [Marketaux](https://www.marketaux.com/)

These additions not only bolstered the project's capabilities but also provided valuable insights into working with external APIs and extending functionality through specialized libraries.

I deployed the app using vercel. [See it live](https://encore-five.vercel.app/)
